1. Product Overview and Objectives

Product Name: Autonomous AI Co-Scientist (Learning Research Assistant)
Purpose: Create a multi-agent AI system that can conduct research autonomously, improve its knowledge base over time, and refine its hypotheses and strategies with minimal human input.

Objectives:

    Enable continuous learning and knowledge updating from live sources (web, APIs, documents) so the AI is always up-to-date on the latest information.

    Achieve autonomous research cycles: the system generates hypotheses, evaluates and refines them, and repeats this process to deepen understanding without human guidance in each loop.

    Implement self-correction and improvement mechanisms, so the AI’s performance (accuracy of insights, quality of reports) improves over time as it learns from past outcomes.

    Produce high-quality, well-structured research outputs (reports, analyses) that could pass for human-generated research, across various domains.

    Minimize the need for human intervention in the research process by building robust feedback loops and trustable evaluation metrics within the system.

2. Functional Requirements

The system must fulfill the following functional requirements:

    Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition: Ability to query search engines and APIs for new information. For example:

        Perform web searches on demand (using tools like Serper for Google search) and scrape content from relevant results.

        Fetch data from domain-specific APIs (scientific databases, news APIs, etc.) and integrate it into the knowledge store.

        Read and parse external documents (PDFs, Word, etc.) provided to the system and add their content to the knowledge base.

    Knowledge Base Management: Maintain an internal knowledge repository:

        Store information in a vector database for semantic retrieval (with configured chunk sizes and embeddings for efficient search).

        Update the repository on a schedule (e.g., daily refresh of certain sources) and in real-time when new info is found.

        Ensure old/outdated information can be identified (timestamped or versioned) and either updated or marked as such.

    Hypothesis Generation: Generate research hypotheses or questions:

        Create initial hypotheses based on user-provided topic or system-identified knowledge gaps.

        The generation should leverage the current knowledge base to be relevant and not duplicate known answers.

        Allow configurable creativity vs. precision (e.g., some hypotheses may be exploratory).

    Hypothesis Evaluation & Critique: Critically evaluate generated hypotheses:

        Cross-check hypotheses against the knowledge base for support or contradictions.

        Score each hypothesis on criteria like plausibility, novelty, and evidence support.

        If a hypothesis is weak or conflicts with known data, flag it for rejection or revision.

    Hypothesis Ranking & Selection: Prioritize hypotheses for further exploration:

        Use a ranking mechanism (such as Elo rating or scoring function) to compare hypotheses pairwise and rank them.

        Select the top N hypotheses to pursue in depth; drop or table the rest.

    Hypothesis Refinement: Refine selected hypotheses iteratively:

        Gather additional information specifically targeted to each hypothesis (e.g., targeted searches or data queries).

        Elaborate the hypothesis into a more detailed form (add specifics, conditions, or sub-hypotheses).

        If evidence contradicts the hypothesis, adjust the hypothesis to accommodate or note the contradiction.

        Continue refinement in multiple iterations if needed, or until the hypothesis is detailed and supported enough.

    Autonomous Discarding of Hypotheses: If at any point a hypothesis is determined to be invalid or unproductive:

        The system should be able to abandon it and remove it from the active set of hypotheses.

        Log the reason for discarding (for learning purposes) and move to other promising hypotheses.

    Collaborative Multi-Agent Workflow: Use multiple specialized agents to handle different tasks:

        Researcher Agent for information retrieval (searching, scraping).

        Analyst/Writer Agent for compiling findings into a report.

        Evaluation/Reviewer Agent for critique and quality control.

        Refinement/Evolution Agent for updating hypotheses.

        Coordinator/Supervisor Agent to oversee the process and manage task delegation (especially in hierarchical mode).

        Agents should communicate results to each other (e.g., the Researcher provides found data to the Analyst; the Evaluator provides feedback to the Refiner).

    Reinforcement Learning Mechanism: Implement a learning component that adjusts the system’s strategy based on outcomes:

        Define a reward metric for successful research outcomes (e.g., hypothesis validated, high-quality report generated).

        The system should internally track performance of each hypothesis or cycle and assign reward/punishment.

        Adjust the hypothesis generation policy or agent behavior using this feedback (this could be via a trained model or heuristic updates).

        Over time, the agents should favor actions that historically led to higher rewards.

    Memory and Context Retention: The system should remember key context across cycles:

        Maintain a memory of which hypotheses have been tried, which sources were useful, and what feedback was given.

        Ensure this memory is referenced in subsequent cycles to avoid repetition and to build on prior knowledge.

        If the system is restarted or paused, it should be able to reload its knowledge base and resume where it left off.

    Output Generation: Produce a final output (research report or analysis):

        The report should be well-structured (with sections, conclusions, references as needed) and written clearly.

        It should incorporate the refined hypotheses and the evidence gathered to support or reject them.

        Save outputs to files (e.g., Markdown or PDF report) and also provide a summary of findings.

        If multiple hypotheses were explored, summarize the rationale for the chosen conclusion or the comparative results.

    User Interaction (if any): Although the system is autonomous, it may allow some user input or oversight:

        Accept a topic or question to investigate from the user.

        Optionally present interim findings or ask for confirmation before proceeding to a new cycle (configurable for more control).

        Allow the user to provide feedback or corrections that the system will learn from (not required, but possible extension).

    Error Handling and Recovery:

        If an external tool fails (e.g., API not responding), the system should handle it gracefully (retry, use alternative source, or skip).

        In case a cycle produces no useful result (e.g., all hypotheses invalid), the system should either try a new approach or report that no valid hypothesis could be found, rather than hang indefinitely.

        Log errors and decisions for debugging and improvement analysis.

3. System Architecture and Components

Overall Architecture: Multi-agent system orchestrated by CrewAI, integrated with knowledge base and learning modules. Key components include:

    Agents & Roles: Each agent is an autonomous LLM (Large Language Model) instance with a specific role and tools:

        Researcher Agent: Uses web search and scraping tools to gather information. Tool examples: SerperDevTool for search​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        , ScrapeWebsiteTool for scraping, custom ResearchAPITool for database queries​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        , PDFSearchTool for document analysis​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

        Analyst/Writer Agent: Summarizes and analyzes information, drafts the report. May use no external tools (or maybe a data visualization tool if needed), relying on the shared knowledge.

        Evaluation (Reflection) Agent: Critiques content and hypotheses. No external tools required; uses the knowledge base and its prompt to perform rigorous evaluation​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

        Ranking Agent: (Could be combined with Evaluation or separate) Implements the Elo tournament comparison for hypotheses​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        . Could be an agent or just a function in code.

        Refinement (Evolution) Agent: Takes feedback and new info to iterate on the hypothesis​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        . Uses similar tools as Researcher to fetch additional evidence if needed.

        Supervisor/Manager Agent: Oversees the process. In sequential mode, this might be minimal, as the Crew orchestrator handles sequence. In hierarchical mode, a Manager agent decides which tasks to delegate to whom and when to loop or stop​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

    CrewAI Orchestration: Utilize CrewAI’s Crew and Task framework to define the workflow:

        Set up tasks for each stage: e.g., hypothesis_task (Generation agent), evaluation_task (Evaluation agent), refinement_task (Refinement agent) as shown in the design​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        ​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

        Configure the process flow as sequential (or hierarchical if a manager is used)​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        ​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

        The Crew will manage passing the context (output of one task as input to the next) automatically.

        Ensure verbose=True or proper logging so that we capture the interactions for analysis.

    Knowledge Base: Central knowledge repository with the following:

        Possibly built on a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, or an in-memory vector store from LangChain). It stores text chunks and embeddings for semantic search.

        CrewAI Knowledge integration: e.g., using PDFKnowledgeSource for static files​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        and custom knowledge sources for APIs​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

        The knowledge base should support operations to add new documents, search for relevant info, and update existing entries. It may use CrewAI’s knowledge management APIs for adding chunks​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

        Embedding model configuration for knowledge: e.g., OpenAI’s text-embedding model as in the Crew setup​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        .

    Memory/Context Handling: In addition to the vector store, each agent might use short-term memory (within a single conversation) and the system might maintain a long-term memory log of past actions (could be a simple database or even notes stored in the knowledge base).

        LangChain (if used) could provide memory modules, but since CrewAI has its own knowledge mechanism, we may rely on that for persistent memory.

    Reinforcement Learning Module: This could be external to CrewAI’s standard loop, implemented as a training script or service:

        Collect data from each cycle (states, actions, rewards).

        A policy network or value network could be implemented (possibly a lightweight model or heuristic policy) that can be improved.

        Tools/Frameworks: Python RL libraries (Stable Baselines3 for policy learning, or custom code using PyTorch/TensorFlow if needed for fine control). The exact integration might be offline training that periodically updates the agents' behavior or scoring function.

        Alternatively, the ranking agent’s Elo system can be part of the core code, as it’s algorithmic (maintain scores for each hypothesis and update after comparisons).

    Tool Integrations: Ensure all API keys and configurations are handled (for search APIs, etc.):

        Use environment variables for keys (CrewAI’s recommended .env loading​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        ).

        The system should be containerized or packaged with these configs easily changeable by engineers (for deployment).

    User Interface (if any): Possibly a simple CLI or web interface where a user inputs a research topic and then the system runs autonomously. The UI can display progress or allow the user to see the final report. (The PRD focuses on backend, but UI considerations can be minimal.)

    Collaboration and Communication: Agents will use CrewAI’s internal message passing. We ensure that:

        The context passed from the researcher agent includes all found information (or references to it in the knowledge base) for the analyst to use.

        The evaluation agent receives both the hypothesis and supporting evidence to critique.

        The refinement agent receives the hypothesis plus the evaluation feedback.

        The knowledge base is accessible at all times so agents can query it as needed mid-task (CrewAI likely handles this with the knowledge_sources parameter in Crew or agent config​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        ​
        file-yk37sywukcz9lgemipzwzj
        ).

    Scalability & Performance: The architecture should handle increasing amounts of data and possibly more agents:

        Using vector DB ensures semantic searches remain efficient even as knowledge grows.

        Agents (LLM calls) are the main computation cost; the system should be designed to minimize unnecessary calls (e.g., don't have multiple agents do the exact same search).

        If needed, allow parallel execution for independent tasks (CrewAI can do parallel in some setups) to speed up processing, though the sequential nature of hypothesis generation/evaluation might inherently be stepwise.

        The system should allow adding new specialized agents easily (plug-and-play via CrewAI configuration) if the project scope grows.

    Frameworks and Libraries:

        CrewAI – core framework for multi-agent orchestration and integration of knowledge/tools.

        LangChain – can be used alongside or within CrewAI for additional utilities (e.g., using LangChain’s tool wrappers or memory structures if helpful, and for vector store integration if CrewAI doesn’t handle a chosen DB).

        Vector Database – e.g., Pinecone or FAISS for knowledge embeddings storage and retrieval.

        LLM Provider – OpenAI GPT-4 (or similar) for the agents’ intelligence, or local models if needed for privacy (depending on use case).

        RL Framework – if implementing learning, consider Stable Baselines3 (for ease of use with Gym environments) or Ray RLlib for distributed training, or even a custom approach using PyTorch to directly optimize a policy.

        Other Tools – Python libraries for scheduling (if implementing scheduled updates, e.g., APScheduler), and for any domain-specific analysis (if the research domain needs numeric computing, libraries like pandas, numpy could be integrated by a Data Processing Agent).

4. Key Success Criteria and Metrics

To evaluate the success of the autonomous learning co-scientist, we will use the following criteria and metrics:

    Accuracy of Outcomes: The system’s research outputs (reports, conclusions) should be factually accurate and supported by evidence. Metrics:

        Expert evaluation of the report’s correctness (e.g., domain experts rate it).

        Number of factual errors or unsupported claims in the output should trend downwards over time as the system learns.

    Quality of Hypotheses: The hypotheses generated should improve in relevance and originality. Metrics:

        Diversity of hypotheses (to ensure creativity) vs. validity (to ensure they’re not nonsense) – perhaps scored by the evaluation agent or external judges.

        Over multiple runs, an increase in the proportion of generated hypotheses that pass the evaluation stage (i.e., fewer are immediately discarded for being flawed).

    Learning Improvement Over Time: The system should demonstrably get “better” with experience. Metrics:

        Track the reward score or Elo scores across iterations – these should show an upward trend indicating better decisions.

        Measure the time or number of cycles required to reach a satisfactory conclusion on similar tasks over time (ideally decreasing as the system learns how to be more efficient).

        Compare results from initial usage vs. after many cycles: e.g., answer some benchmark questions now and again after the system has processed a lot of information; see improvement in scores or correctness.

    Autonomy and Adaptability: How well does the system handle new, unseen challenges without human help? Metrics:

        The number of cycles it can run without any human intervention or corrections needed. We aim for high autonomy.

        Ability to incorporate entirely new data sources on the fly (e.g., if a new relevant API appears, can the system integrate it and use it effectively in the next cycle? This could be tested in a controlled way).

        Robustness tests: intentionally feed an outdated piece of info and see if the system updates/corrects it when newer data is encountered.

    Efficiency of Research Process: The system should not only be accurate but also efficient in its approach. Metrics:

        Average time per cycle, and overall time to complete a research task. (The goal is improvement but also keep within reasonable bounds, especially if scaled).

        Resource usage (API calls, etc.) – track how the system optimizes its use of tools. For example, if it learns to avoid redundant searches, the number of API calls per successful outcome might drop.

    Collaboration Efficacy: The multi-agent collaboration should yield better results than a single agent approach. Metrics:

        Compare outputs from the full multi-agent system vs. a single-agent doing all tasks in a monolithic prompt. The multi-agent system should produce more coherent, well-evidenced reports.

        Internal metrics: Does the evaluation agent catch most errors? Does the refinement agent significantly improve hypotheses? These can be measured by the changes in hypothesis quality pre- and post-refinement as scored by some evaluator.

    Scalability and Maintainability: As a product for engineering, we also consider:

        Ease of adding new knowledge sources or agents without refactoring major code (qualitative success criteria).

        The system running reliably over extended periods (e.g., can it run a 10-cycle research project overnight without crashing).

        Clear logging and transparency: engineers and users should be able to trace why the AI made certain decisions (which is important for trust). Success if the system’s logs or explanations are detailed enough for debugging and trust-building.

    User Satisfaction (if applicable): If end-users (researchers using the tool) are involved:

        Survey or feedback from users on whether the AI co-scientist provided useful insights and saved them time.

        Adoption rate in research teams (a longer-term product success measure).
