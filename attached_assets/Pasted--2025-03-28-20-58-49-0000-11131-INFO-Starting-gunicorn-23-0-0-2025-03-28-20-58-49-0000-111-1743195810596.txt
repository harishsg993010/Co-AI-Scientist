# Agent: Crew Manager
## Task: 
        As the Inventor Agent, your task is to generate creative and novel approaches for exploring the research topic: Impact of social media on adolescent mental health.
        
        PROCESS:
        1. Problem Definition: Interpret the research topic and identify the key challenges or opportunities for innovation.
        2. Ideation: Generate several candidate ideas using creative strategies:
           - Analogy: Relate the problem to concepts from other domains
           - Combination: Merge features from different existing solutions
           - Abstraction: Focus on the core principles of the problem
           - Contradiction: Challenge assumptions and conventional thinking
           - Pattern matching: Identify useful patterns in related fields
        3. Concept Development: Elaborate on the most promising ideas with sufficient detail

        DELIVERABLE:
        For each idea (aim for 3-5 highly original concepts), provide:
        1. A concise title and description of the novel approach or solution
        2. The creative strategy used to generate this idea (analogy, combination, etc.)
        3. How this approach differs from conventional thinking in this field
        4. Potential applications or implementations of the idea
        5. A brief analysis of possible challenges and how they might be overcome
        
        These ideas will serve as the foundation for the researcher to develop testable hypotheses.
        Prioritize unconventional, breakthrough thinking that could lead to significant advances in understanding Impact of social media on adolescent mental health.

Tool Description: Ask a specific question to one of the following coworkers: Inventor and Ideation Specialist
The input to this tool should be the coworker, the question you have for them, and ALL necessary context to ask the question properly, they know nothing about the question, so share absolutely everything you know, don't reference things but instead explain them.



# Agent: Crew Manager
## Thought: Thought: To generate creative and novel approaches for exploring the research topic "Impact of social media on adolescent mental health," I need to engage the Inventor and Ideation Specialist. They will help in generating several candidate ideas using creative strategies as outlined in the process. I will start by asking the Inventor to define the problem and identify key challenges or opportunities for innovation.

Moving on then. I MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give my best final answer not both at the same time. When responding, I must use the following format:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [Delegate work to coworker, Ask question to coworker]
Action Input: the input to the action, dictionary enclosed in curly braces
Observation: the result of the action
```
This Thought/Action/Action Input/Result can repeat N times. Once I know the final answer, I must return the following format:

```
Thought: I now can give a great answer
Final Answer: Your final answer must be the great and the most complete as possible, it must be outcome described
