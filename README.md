![LLM Reasoner 2]()



### Core Technologies
- **CrewAI framework** for research coordination
- **GPT-4o powered multi-agent** hypothesis generation
- **Intelligent workflow management** for complex scientific processes
- **Dynamic data integration**
- **Adaptive AI research assistance** with enhanced model capabilities

## System Architecture

The Co-Scientist system utilizes a multi-agent architecture with 12 specialized AI agents:

### Core Agents
1. **Inventor Agent** - Generates creative ideas and solutions
2. **Researcher Agent** - Conducts literature reviews and data collection
3. **Analyst Agent** - Analyzes research findings with statistical methods
4. **Evaluator Agent** - Evaluates hypotheses against scientific standards
5. **Refiner Agent** - Refines hypotheses based on feedback
6. **Supervisor Agent** - Coordinates research workflow between agents

### Specialized Agents
7. **Generation Agent** - Creates diverse approaches to research problems
8. **Ranking Agent** - Prioritizes hypotheses through scientific debates
9. **Reflection Agent** - Analyzes research progress and identifies insights
10. **Evolution Agent** - Evolves hypotheses with improved grounding
11. **Proximity Check Agent** - Evaluates hypothesis alignment with research goals
12. **Meta-Review Agent** - Synthesizes research findings and identifies patterns

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Research Cycles**: Complete end-to-end research process automation
- **Hypothesis Management**: Generation, refinement, and evaluation of scientific hypotheses
- **Scientific Paper Generation**: Creates formal research papers in arXiv format
- **Achievement System**: Gamified tracking of research progress
- **Vector Knowledge Base**: Stores and retrieves research information

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/harishsg993010/Co-AI-Scientist.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

4. Run the application:
```
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000
2. Enter a research topic to begin the autonomous research process
3. Monitor research progress through the status page
4. Review generated hypotheses and research findings
5. Access formal research papers generated by the system

## Development

The project uses a Flask web application with SQLAlchemy for database management. The CrewAI framework enables multi-agent collaboration for complex research tasks.
