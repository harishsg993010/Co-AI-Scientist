# Agent: Crew Manager
## Thought: Thought: To generate creative and novel approaches for exploring the research topic "Impact of social media on adolescent mental health," I need to engage the Inventor and Ideation Specialist. They will help in generating several candidate ideas using creative strategies as outlined in the process. I will start by asking the Inventor to define the problem and identify key challenges or opportunities for innovation.
## Using tool: Ask question to coworker
## Tool Input: 
"{\"question\": \"Please interpret the research topic 'Impact of social media on adolescent mental health' and identify the key challenges or opportunities for innovation.\", \"context\": \"We are tasked with generating creative and novel approaches for exploring this research topic. The first step is to define the problem and identify challenges or opportunities for innovation.\"}"

Moving on then. I MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give my best final answer not both at the same time. When responding, I must use the following format:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [Delegate work to coworker, Ask question to coworker]
Action Input: the input to the action, dictionary enclosed in curly braces
Observation: the result of the action
```
This Thought/Action/Action Input/Result can repeat N times. Once I know the final answer, I must return the following format:

```
Thought: I now can give a great answer
Final Answer: Your final answer must be the great and the most complete as possible, it must be outcome described

```
